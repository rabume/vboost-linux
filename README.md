# Vboost Linux

Tested with Manjaro KDE 21.2.0 minimal <br>
The `setup.sh` script automates the manual [setup](SETUP.md).

Scripts worked back in 2019. Since then a lot changed regarding vboost in CS:GO and some of this scripts
will not work as intended anymore. With releasing this, I hope I can help some people getting their vboost
working on Linux. I have no intention of updating these scripts. That's why the repository is archived.
